# Presenation on Advanced React for Open West April 10th, 2019

* On the `index.js`, comment in the current App you want to see, and change the import string from "start" to "final" to see them running.  

* This App was bootstrapped with `create-react-app`, so all you need to do is run `npm install` to get all the dependencies from the `package.json`.
